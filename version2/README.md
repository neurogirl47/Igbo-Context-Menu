I created a new version with a horizontal menu. This one seems to be working and the menu displays on keypresses and is removed after you click your selection.

My next goal is to work on some css fine tuning. Add some error handlers and possibly populate the menus from a different file (array, xml, or json) instead of having them hardcoded into the html.
